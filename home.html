        <h2>Overview:</h2>
        <p>
          Visual design is a polarizing subject and is often very subject to
          personal opinion. However, there are times when we need to determine
          which version of a design we wish to implement. Rather then rely on
          our personal opinions, which often may be biased, we can use A/B testing
          and statistical analysis to try to determine if one design is better
          than another.
        </p>
        <p>
          For this project, we created 2 distinct designs for a web store.
          Users were tasked with adding 150 dollars worth of plants to the cart.
          After collecting our data, we plan on using statistics to analyze
          our results and hopefully reach interesting conclusions.

      <h2>Hypotheses:</h2>
      <p>
        The first step of our statistical analysis is to come up with our
        Hypotheses. For this project, we are interested in two specific metrics:
        time to completion and return rate. For each metric, we want to create
        a set of Hypotheses, a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis
        for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        A null hypothesis takes the position that there is no difference between
        versions A and B of our website. An alternative hypothesis states that
        there is a difference. It might seem a bit odd that by default, we assume
        that there is no difference (since this is the null hypothesis). The
        reasoning for this has to do with statistics, and is a bit beyond the 
        scope of the write-up, so I'm including a link
        <a href="https://support.minitab.com/en-us/minitab/18/help-and-how-to/statistics/basic-statistics/supporting-topics/basics/null-and-alternative-hypotheses/">
        here 
        </a>
        with contains more information.
      </p>
      <h3>Time to Completion:</h3>
      <p><b>Null:</b> There is no significant difference in time to completion between
      Site A and Site B.</p>
      <p><b>Alternative:</b> Time to completion will be shorter for Site B
      because the grid layout makes finding different items easier and therefore
      should reduce the time needed to complete the task.</p>
      <h3>Return Rate:</h3>
      <p><b>Null:</b> There is no significant difference in return rate between Site A
      and Site B.</p>
      <p><b>Alternative:</b> There is a difference in return rate between Site A
      and Site B because Site A highlights quantities and prices in red,
      which should change how often a user needs to check the cart for a total
      price.</p>
      <p>
        Note that our alternative hypotheses are worded slightly differently
        because our time to completion test was a 1-sided statistical test while
        our return rate test was a 2-sided statistical test. <a href="https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faq-what-are-the-differences-between-one-tailed-and-two-tailed-tests/">Click here</a>

        <h2>All About Data:</h2>
        <p>
          The process of data collection can be split into 3 distinct parts.
          First, the actual collection of data. Next, the cleaning of data. And
          finally, the processing of our cleaned data.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Collection:</h3>
        <p>
          To collect our data, we added listeners to each sites' buttons.
          When a button was clicked by a user, a new log line would be generated.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Cleaning:</h3>
        <p>
          Once we have our raw logs, we need to clean our data. An example of a
          potential bad log is a user that loaded the site but did not interact
          with the site. These bad logs should be removed as they can skew our
          results.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Analysis:</h3>
        <p>
          The final step is to analyze our clean data, which we do using our
          custom Python scripts. We can use the numerical outputs from our
          Python scripts to reach important conclusions.

      <h3>Results:</h3>
      <p>
        Although text is great for communicating ideas, reading can get old
        fast. Therefore, we chose to display our results in the form of an
        infographic!

        <h3>Takeaways:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Having a sufficient quantity of data is extremely important.
            With the relatively limited number of users in my data set, it is
            hard to get a statistically significant result. I think that if I had
            more users and thus more data, I might have been able to obtain different
            results.
          </li>
          <li>
            It will be easier to get statistically significant results
            using big design changes as opposed to smaller design changes.
            As a whole, the differences between my Site A and Site B definitely existed,
            but they were not drastic, which might explain why I did
            not obtain statistically significant results for either metric.
          </li>
          <li>
            Having a diverse pool of <b>new</b> users is important. Examining the data points
            individually, I found that most users had similar completion times. I
            hypothesize that part of this can be attributed to familiarity with the task.
            Since most students tested multiple websites, it would be very easy to memorize
            exactly how many plants of type D you need to add to the cart to reach 150 dollars.
            This skew the results since the users are not "new users". 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Although I am disappointed that I did not obtain statistically
          significant results for either of my metrics, I still found that this
          assignment was a great learning opportunity. I think A/B testing
          and statistical analysis are very important tools, and I will definitely
          use them in the future to analyze my designs.
